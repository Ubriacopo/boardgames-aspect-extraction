> only having nothing (or little) to do, but also nothing (or little) to think about.

## Approach

## Notes

As it also considers little to think about it has to be measured in the terms of relative time during the
game. While a match of Bang! can be fast-paced the downtime is high as you nearly never have to think about
anything and your turn can be rapidly played to wait for the other players. Also, elimination causes downtime
for the dead as they stop playing. (Root, Bang! have high downtime while Paleo, Zombicide or other Coop games have
nearly zero).
