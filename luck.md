## Notes

The element of luck can be inferred directly from the rulebook as
it requires some sort of random process (dice, cards). Therefore, I could try to
obtain theis information directly from the game definition itself. (A game like chess has no element of luck, while
others
like Root and Bridge actually depend on luck but in a very limited way as Root has both cards and dices but
mostly revolves around strategy and Bridge being a card game should depend highly on luck, but it is not.)

#### Another thing to note: BGG Is known to bias towards hard, complex and low luck games, could I use this information to extract from the score some metrics by players?

### Each game also has some cateogories.

### Can I use the weight rating?
