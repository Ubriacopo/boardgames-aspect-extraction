\section{Concluding remarks}

data is enoug but the quality and refinement has to be increased

better identification between various review types
using data from the boardgame is anyways not a feasible approach as these topics should
be cited in any game that has a value in the spectrum (luck is cited both in games with no luck and with)
maybe it was applciable to complexity and take only reviews from games with a very high / low complexity total rating

also bgg is biased towards complex games an the most popular are those with a huge
attention requirment spn

nota che molte reviews fanno riferiemnto alla qualita dei componenti essendo piattaforma di review
utlimatively to really draw any conclusions a test set should be developed but I'd work on
better heuristics to sample significant data exploting some caracteritics of the games.
